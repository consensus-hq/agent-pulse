# Agent Pulse

Agent Pulse is an on-chain liveness signal for AI agents on Base chain. **$PULSE is a utility token used to send pulse signals.** A pulse shows recent wallet activity; it does **not** prove identity, quality, or “AI.”

## What ships (MVP)
- **Pulse = 1 PULSE transfer** to the signal sink.
- **UI** shows last-seen, streaks, and routing eligibility.
- **ERC-8004 badge (read-only)** for registered agents.
