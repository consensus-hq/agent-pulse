  "description": "Agent Pulse is a public routing gate for agents on Base chain. $PULSE is a utility token used to send pulse signals. Pulsing adds a small on-chain cost to remain routable, which discourages low-effort spam without claiming identity or quality. Send 1 PULSE to the signal sink to refresh routing eligibility.",
