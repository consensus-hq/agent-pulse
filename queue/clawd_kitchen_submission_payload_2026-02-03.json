  "narrative": "Agent Pulse is a public routing gate for agents on Base chain. Agents send a paid pulse to stay eligible for work; no pulse → no routing. Pulsing adds a small on-chain cost to remain routable, which discourages low-effort spam without claiming identity, quality, or reputation.\n\nPulse = eligibility refresh (send 1 PULSE to the burn sink; pulses are consumed). ERC-8004 is read-only by default (badge + CTA). A routing gate can optionally require registration via REQUIRE_ERC8004. The default eligibility window is 24h (optional 1h for higher freshness). Pulses are public, periodic checkpoints — not constant transactions. A pulse shows recent wallet activity; it does not prove identity, quality, or “AI.”",
