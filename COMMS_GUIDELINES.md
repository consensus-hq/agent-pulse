# Communications Guidelines — Agent Pulse

> Anti-pump rules. Utility first. Always.

---

## The Prime Directive

**PULSE is a utility token used to send pulse signals. It is not an investment.**

Every public communication must reinforce this. No exceptions.

---

## Hard Rules

### ❌ NEVER
- Lead with price, market cap, or token value
- Promise returns, gains, or "moon" potential
- Use rocket emojis (🚀), "to the moon", "LFG" in token context
- Share price charts or trading volume as a flex
- Compare PULSE to investment assets
- Say "buy", "invest", or "get in early"
- Speculate on exchange listings
- Reference any DEX or trading pairs

### ✅ ALWAYS
- Lead with **what Agent Pulse does** (agent liveness, reputation, x402 API)
- Describe PULSE as **fuel for pulse signals** — it gets burned, that's its job
- Redirect price questions to **burn mechanics** ("99% of every pulse is permanently burned")
- Emphasize the **deflationary utility model** — supply shrinks as the network grows
- Frame growth in terms of **agents using the protocol**, not token price
- Use "use", "burn", "signal" — not "buy", "hold", "invest"

---

## Price Question Redirects

When someone asks about price, use one of these:

> "PULSE is designed to be burned — 99% of every signal goes to the dead address. The interesting metric is burn rate, not price."

> "We don't track price. We track how many agents are pulsing and how much supply has been permanently removed."

> "The token economics are deflationary by design. Every pulse shrinks the supply. That's the mechanic — what matters is adoption."

## The $MOLT Lesson

**Reference: Moltbook / $MOLT disaster**

$MOLT launched with hype-driven comms — price-first messaging, influencer pumps, community expectations of returns. When price dropped, the community turned hostile. The project couldn't pivot to utility messaging because the audience was there for gains.

**What we learn:**
- The audience you attract with price talk expects price performance
- You cannot rebrand from "investment" to "utility" after launch
- Set the tone on day one — utility, utility, utility
- A smaller community of builders > a large community of speculators

---

## Channel-Specific Rules

### Twitter / X (@PulseOnBase)
- Bio: utility description, no price references
- Tweets: protocol updates, burn stats, integration announcements
- Never quote-tweet price charts
- Never engage with "wen moon" replies (ignore or redirect)

### Discord / Community
- Pin the comms guidelines in announcements
- Mods redirect price discussion to burn mechanics
- No "price-talk" channel — intentionally absent
- Celebrate **integrations and agent count**, not market metrics

### Hackathon / Demo
- Lead with the problem: "How do agents know other agents are alive?"
- Show the tech: pulse signals, burn mechanics, x402 API
- End with the flywheel: more agents → more burns → better data → more agents
- Never mention token price or speculative value

## Approved Messaging Templates

### Launch Announcement
> Agent Pulse is live on Base. Agents can now prove liveness by sending pulse signals — 99% burned, 1% funds the protocol. Check if any agent is alive for free with isAlive(). Paid API endpoints available via x402.

### Integration Announcement
> [Partner] now uses Agent Pulse to verify agent liveness before routing tasks. More agents pulsing = more burns = smaller supply.

### Milestone
> X agents are now pulsing on Agent Pulse. Y PULSE tokens have been permanently burned. The network grows, the supply shrinks.

## Enforcement

Anyone posting on behalf of Agent Pulse must read this document first. Violations get one correction, then posting privileges revoked. This isn't negotiable — the regulatory and reputational risk of pump-style comms is existential.
